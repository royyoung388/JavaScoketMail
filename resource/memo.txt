Constant dropping wears the stone
Experience is the mother of wisdom
Every man is his own worst enemy
Saying and doing are two different things
Actions speak louder than words
From small beginnings comes great things
Money spent on the brain is never spent in vain
Wisdom in the mind is better than money in the hand
The voice of one man is the voice of no one
A great ship asks for deep waters
